# Introduction

In this project, I use TensorFlow as the open source CNN toolbox for all the experimental study.
All the experiments are run on a server with the following environment:
* Debian GNU/Linux 8.5 (Jessie)
* CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4930K CPU @ 3.40GHz (6 cores, 12 processors)
* GPU: None

# LeNet model for MNIST and CIFAR-10


# Training CNN Models on Caltech 101
